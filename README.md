- 👋 Hi, I’m @R24D24, but people tend to call me Rick. I'm Dutch.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to make apps for my mobile phone. Right now just for the fun of coding and learning to code, but maybe eventually it might turn out profitable.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift to use it in an Apple/iPhone environment.
- 💞️ I’m not yet looking to collaborate on app development, since I want to learn first. But I hope to find tips, tricks and help in cases I get stuck.
- 📫 How to reach me? You can mail me at r24.d24@protonmail.com.
